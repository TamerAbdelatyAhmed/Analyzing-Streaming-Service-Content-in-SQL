# Analyzing-Streaming-Service-Content-in-SQL
Welcome to your webinar workspace! You can follow along as we analyze the data in a SQL database and visualize the results.

To set up your integration, create a PostgreSQL integration with the following credentials:

    Integration Name: Streaming Codealong
    Hostname: workspacedemodb.datacamp.com
    Database: streaming
    Username: streaming_codealong
    Password: streaming_codealong

Note: This is the solution workspace, and you will need to connect your own integration (or setup one using the credentials above) to use it!
